    <p><h2>Let's Start Cooking</h2></p>
    <p><h3><em>Getting lost in the sauce...</p></h3></em>
        <ol>
            <li> In a larget pot, heat olive oil over medium heat until it shimmers.
            <li> Dice one medium yellow onion and add it to the pot. Sweat and saute until transluscent, about 8-10 minutes.
            <li> Roughly chop garlic cloves and add it to the pot along with the pepper flakes. Saute for another 3-5 minutes.
            <li> Add the can of tomatoes and lightly crush them with a wooden spoon.
            <li> Drop the parmesan rind and turn down the heat to medium-low.
            <li> Season with salt and pepper to taste.    
            <li> Let simmer for as long as possible, 30 minutes minimum.                       
            </ol>
    <p><h3><em>Let's get beefy with it...</p></h3></em>
        <ol>        
            <li> In a large bowl, add the beef, cheese, egg, and bread crumbs.
            <li> Zest the lemon, being carfeul you don't zest too far down to the pithe (the white part) - add it to the bowl.
            <li> Mince or finely chop two garlic cloves, adding it to the mix - repeat with the parsley.
            <li> Add a large pinch of course Kosher Salt as well as a few grinds of fresh pepper.
            <li> Mix all the ingredients together, until everything is well combined. Don't over mix or the meatballs will be tough.
            <li> Form the meat into 1 inch balls and set aside.
            <li> In a large skillet, add olive oil.
            <li> Once the oil is shimmering, not smoking, add meatballs. Careful to not over-crowd the pan, as the meatballs will start steaming, not searing.
            <li> Develop a golden crust on all sides and remove the meatballs from the skillet, setting aside.
            </ol>
    <p><h3><em>Mixing and mingling...</p></h3></em>
        <ol>
            <li> Add all the meatballs to our marinara sauce.
            <li> Let the sauce and meatballs mingle and continue simmering for another 15 minutes.
            </ol>
    <p><h3><em>The home stretch...</p></h3></em>
        <ol>
            <li> Cook the pasta according to box directions.
            <li> Drain and add the spaghetti to the sauce.
            <li> Toss everything together.
            <li> Finish the dish with a drizzle of Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Freshly grated Parmesa cheese, and chopped Basil.
            <li><em>Enjoy!</em>
            </ol>
