        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
        <p>Everyone loves pizza and this one is no exception! This super simple pie is a classic that will sure to please
            any pizza parties you plan to host. The key to this pizza are the ingredients. Try and get a hold of local tomatoes
            that are in season. The summer is a great time, as tomatoes are unbelievably juicy and sweet. Fresh basil from your
            community farmers market is ideal. Basil brings so much fregrance and a subtle harbacious quality that cannot be replicated.
            Lastly, splurge a little. Buy yourself high-quality mozzarella. The mozzarella is what brings everything together. Finish
            it off with a drizzle of grassy Extra Virgin Olive Oil; it just puts it over the top. Super savory, crispy and light, 
            all while being so comforting and satisfying to eat!</p>
